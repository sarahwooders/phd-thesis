%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Distributed applications and web services, such as online stores or social networks, are expected to be scalable, available, responsive, and fault-tolerant. To meet these steep requirements in the face of high round-trip latencies, network partitions, server failures, and load spikes, applications use eventually consistent datastores that allow them to weaken the consistency of some data. However, making this transition is highly error-prone because relaxed consistency models are notoriously difficult to understand and test.In this work, we propose a new programming model for distributed data that makes consistency properties explicit and uses a type system to enforce consistency safety. With the Inconsistent, Performance-bound, Approximate (IPA) storage system, programmers specify performance targets and correctness requirements as constraints on persistent data structures and handle uncertainty about the result of datastore reads using new consistency types. We implement a prototype of this model in Scala on top of an existing datastore, Cassandra, and use it to make performance/correctness tradeoffs in two applications: a ticket sales service and a Twitter clone. Our evaluation shows that IPA prevents consistency-based programming errors and adapts consistency automatically in response to changing network conditions, performing comparably to weak consistency and 2-10\texttimes{} faster than strong consistency.},

abstract = {Recently, the scope of databases has been extended to many non-standard applications, and serializability is found to be too restrictive for such applications. In general, two approaches are adopted to address this problem. The first approach considers placing more structure on data objects to exploit type specific properties while keeping serializability as the correctness criterion. The other approach uses explicit semantics of transactions and databases to permit interleaved executions of transactions that are non-serializable. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the two approaches by using the notion of serializability with bounded inconsistency. Users are free to specifiy the maximum level of inconsistency that can be allowed in the executions of operations dynamically. In particular, if no inconsistency is allowed in the execution of any operation, the protocol will be reduced to a standard strict two phase locking protocol based on type-specific semantics of data objects. Bounded inconsistency can be applied to many areas which do not require exact values of the data such as for gathering information for statistical purpose, for making high level decisions and reasoning in expert systems which can tolerate uncertainty in input data.},

While effectively ensuring low latency responses, this approach is at odds with maintaining cross-site consistency. We make three contributions to address this tension. First, we propose RedBlue consistency, which enables blue operations to be fast (and eventually consistent) while the remaining red operations are strongly consistent (and slow). Second, to make use of fast operation whenever possible and only resort to strong consistency when needed, we identify conditions delineating when operations can be blue and must be red. Third, we introduce a method that increases the space of potential blue operations by breaking them into separate generator and shadow phases. We built a coordination infrastructure called Gemini that offers RedBlue consistency, and we report on our experience modifying the TPC-W and RUBiS benchmarks and an online social network to use Gemini. Our experimental results show that RedBlue consistency provides substantial performance gains without sacrificing consistency.},

abstract = {Geo-replicated, distributed data stores that support complex online applications, such as social networks, must provide an "always-on" experience where operations always complete with low latency. Today's systems often sacrifice strong consistency to achieve these goals, exposing inconsistencies to their clients and necessitating complex application logic. In this paper, we identify and define a consistency model---causal consistency with convergent conflict handling, or causal+---that is the strongest achieved under these constraints.We present the design and implementation of COPS, a key-value store that delivers this consistency model across the wide-area. A key contribution of COPS is its scalability, which can enforce causal dependencies between keys stored across an entire cluster, rather than a single server like previous systems. The central approach in COPS is tracking and explicitly checking whether causal dependencies between keys are satisfied in the local cluster before exposing writes. Further, in COPS-GT, we introduce get transactions in order to obtain a consistent view of multiple keys without locking or blocking. Our evaluation shows that COPS completes operations in less than a millisecond, provides throughput similar to previous systems when using one server per cluster, and scales well as we increase the number of servers in each cluster. It also shows that COPS-GT provides similar latency, throughput, and scaling to COPS for common workloads.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of TARDiS (Transactional Asynchronously Replicated Divergent Store), a transactional key-value store explicitly designed for weakly-consistent systems. Reasoning about these systems is hard, as neither causal consistency nor per-object eventual convergence allow applications to deal satisfactorily with write-write conflicts. TARDiS instead exposes as its fundamental abstraction the set of conflicting branches that arise in weakly-consistent systems. To this end, TARDiS introduces a new concurrency control mechanism: branch-on-conflict. On the one hand, TARDiS guarantees that storage will appear sequential to any thread of execution that extends a branch, keeping application logic simple. On the other, TARDiS provides applications, when needed, with the tools and context necessary to merge branches atomically, when and how applications want. Since branch-on-conflict in TARDiS is fast, weakly-consistent applications can benefit from adopting this paradigm not only for operations issued by different sites, but also, when appropriate, for conflicting local operations. We find that TARDiS reduces coding complexity for these applications and that judicious branch-on-conflict can improve their local throughput at each site by two to eight times.},

abstract = {Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations out-of-date. Allowing staleness reduces communication costs (batched updates and cached reads) and synchronization (less waiting for locks or straggling threads). One approach is to increase the number of iterations between barriers in the oft-used Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model of parallelizing, which mitigates these costs when all threads proceed at the same speed. A more flexible approach, called Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP), avoids barriers and allows threads to be a bounded number of iterations ahead of the current slowest thread. Extensive experiments with ML algorithms for topic modeling, collaborative filtering, and PageRank show that both approaches significantly increase convergence speeds, behaving similarly when there are no stragglers, but SSP outperforms BSP in the presence of stragglers.},

abstract = {Data store replication results in a fundamental trade-off between operation latency and data consistency. In this paper, we examine this trade-off in the context of quorum-replicated data stores. Under partial, or non-strict quorum replication, a data store waits for responses from a subset of replicas before answering a query, without guaranteeing that read and write replica sets intersect. As deployed in practice, these configurations provide only basic eventual consistency guarantees, with no limit to the recency of data returned. However, anecdotally, partial quorums are often "good enough" for practitioners given their latency benefits. In this work, we explain why partial quorums are regularly acceptable in practice, analyzing both the staleness of data they return and the latency benefits they offer. We introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency, which provides expected bounds on staleness with respect to both versions and wall clock time. We derive a closed-form solution for versioned staleness as well as model real-time staleness for representative Dynamo-style systems under internet-scale production workloads. Using PBS, we measure the latency-consistency trade-off for partial quorum systems. We quantitatively demonstrate how eventually consistent systems frequently return consistent data within tens of milliseconds while offering significant latency benefits.},

abstract = {Choosing a cloud storage system and specific operations for reading and writing data requires developers to make decisions that trade off consistency for availability and performance. Applications may be locked into a choice that is not ideal for all clients and changing conditions. Pileus is a replicated key-value store that allows applications to declare their consistency and latency priorities via consistency-based service level agreements (SLAs). It dynamically selects which servers to access in order to deliver the best service given the current configuration and system conditions. In application-specific SLAs, developers can request both strong and eventual consistency as well as intermediate guarantees such as read-my-writes. Evaluations running on a worldwide test bed with geo-replicated data show that the system adapts to varying client-server latencies to provide service that matches or exceeds the best static consistency choice and server selection scheme.},

abstract = {The tradeoffs between consistency, performance, and availability are well understood. Traditionally, however, designers of replicated systems have been forced to choose from either strong consistency guarantees or none at all. This paper explores the semantic space between traditional strong and optimistic consistency models for replicated services. We argue that an important class of applications can tolerate relaxed consistency, but benefit from bounding the maximum rate of inconsistent access in an application-specific manner. Thus, we develop a set of metrics, Numerical Error, Order Error, and Staleness, to capture the consistency spectrum. We then present the design and implementation of TACT, a middleware layer that enforces arbitrary consistency bounds among replicas using these metrics. Finally, we show that three replicated applications demonstrate significant semantic and performance benefits from using our framework.},

abstract = {Replicating data across multiple data centers allows using data closer to the client, reducing latency for applications, and increases the availability in the event of a data center failure. MDCC (Multi-Data Center Consistency) is an optimistic commit protocol for geo-replicated transactions, that does not require a master or static partitioning, and is strongly consistent at a cost similar to eventually consistent protocols. MDCC takes advantage of Generalized Paxos for transaction processing and exploits commutative updates with value constraints in a quorum-based system. Our experiments show that MDCC outperforms existing synchronous transactional replication protocols, such as Megastore, by requiring only a single message round-trip in the normal operational case independent of the master-location and by scaling linearly with the number of machines as long as transaction conflict rates permit.},

abstract = {Minimizing coordination, or blocking communication between concurrently executing operations, is key to maximizing scalability, availability, and high performance in database systems. However, uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromise application correctness, or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable transactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all applications, sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a formal framework, invariant confluence, that determines whether an application requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant confluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe, coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application invariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e., integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant confluent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution, notably a 25-fold improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.},
