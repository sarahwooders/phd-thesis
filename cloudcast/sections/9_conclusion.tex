\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we explored the problem of cost-optimized cloud multicast by introducing overlay networks of ephemeral VM waypoints that exploit path-specific cloud pricing to significantly reduce cost and improve throughput.
We developed a MILP formulation of this problem and introduced approximations that make the solving time feasible for practical applications. 
%We demonstrated that these approximations result in $30.68\times$ speedup in solve time with similar solution quality.
%To instantiate our multicast overlay network of ephemeral VMs we developed the Cloudcast system around our MILP formulation. 
Our evaluation against academic and commercial baselines demonstrated up to a $61.5\%$ reduction in cost and a $2.3\times$ improvement in runtime. 
\sys{} has been released as part of the Skyplane open source project  with pluggable planning algorithms to enable future research in this space.
